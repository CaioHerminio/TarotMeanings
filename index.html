        <h3>The High Priestess</h3>
        <p>The High Priestess sits between the pillars of intuition and mystery, her wisdom flowing from the unconscious like moonlight on still water. She guards hidden knowledge, urging us to listen to our inner voice and trust the unseen. Her power lies in silence, dreams, and the secrets that unfold when we surrender to the unknown.</p>

        <h3>The Hermit</h3>
        <p>The Hermit walks alone with his lantern, a solitary seeker whose light illuminates the path of introspection. He teaches that true wisdom comes from turning inward, away from distractions, to find answers in solitude. Where the High Priestess reveals through intuition, the Hermit discovers through deliberate contemplation.</p>

        <p>The High Priestess, like <span style="color: #d3a93f;">Saint Teresa of Ávila</span> in her mystical ecstasies, receives divine wisdom through surrender—her throne between the pillars mirrors Teresa’s Interior Castle, where truth emerges in sacred stillness. The Hermit, akin to <span style="color: #d3a93f;">Saint John the Baptist</span>’s desert solitude, actively purifies his spirit in wilderness silence, his lantern a burning echo of John’s voice "preparing the way." Both saints embody the paradox of revelation: Teresa’s passive union with God’s whispers reflects the Priestess’ moonlit intuition, while John’s ascetic seeking mirrors the Hermit’s sun-scorched path to dawn. One dwells in the mystery; the other excavates it. Yet their roads converge where solitude meets revelation.</p>
